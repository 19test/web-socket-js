    - web-socket-js now speaks WebSocket version hybi-10. Old versions spoke
      hixie-76. If you really need web-socket-js which speaks hixie-76, you can
      get it from
      [hixie-76 branch](https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js/tree/hixie-76),
      but the branch is no longer maintained.
